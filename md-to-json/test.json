 "/iati-activities/iati-activity/description/narrative": "Through the AHF 3rd Reserve Allocation, ACTED will provide lifesaving\nwinterization assistance to 1566 vulnerable households (as standard\nhousehold contains on average 7 members, this project will have 10,962\nproject participants) facing critical climatic conditions during the\nAfghan winter in Badakhshan province. Due to the extremely low\ntemperatures during winter and the high levels of displacement and\npoverty across Afghanistan, many households and communities are either\nliving in inadequate or makeshift shelters for the conditions or lack\nfinancial resources to provide sufficient heating, therefore exposing\nthem to increased health risks such as respiratory infections,\npneumonia, and hypothermia, which can be fatal. ACTED is uniquely\npositioned to provide seasonal winterization support to recent\nshock-affected households as a priority. Badakhshan is susceptible to\nextreme cold temperatures, high snowfall, having high numbers of people\nexposed to snow, and having high gaps of people that remain in need of\nwinterization assistance. ACTED will aim to support recently shock\naffected households, protracted displaced households, vulnerable host\ncommunities and others with high levels of need with a cluster standard\nwinterization package for heating assistance, and a complementary\nassistance for blankets and clothing to all 1566 project participants,\nand will aim to complement existing AHF funded emergency livestock and\nagricultural needs programming.\n\nTo protect the most vulnerable households that are at risk during\nwinter in Yawan, Jorm, Teshkan amp Shuhada districts, ACTED will\nprovide standard winterization heating packages, consisting of a\none-off 200 USD cash assistance (provided to 10,962 project\nparticipants in Afghani) to cover heating materials for 3 months and a\none-off 131 distribution covering blankets and winter clothing to all\n1566 project participants, ACTED will tailor the number of\nbeneficiaries per area based on initial assessment, but will aim to\nreach between 390 and 395 households in each districts targeted.\nAssistance will be provided through unconditional, unrestricted cash in\naccordance with the ES/NFI cluster standards. This project will have a\ndirect impact on reducing protection risks associated with harmful\ncoping mechanisms, in IDP settlements and displacement areas.\n",
